    <h2>ABOUT</h2><br><br><br>
   
     <center><p>I am pursuing Electrical & Electronics Engineering in Muthayammal Engineering College, Rasipuram, Namakkal(Dt).<br>
     My first experience with code was at the time when I studied +1 and +2 in my school days.<br>
     Then, in college My struggle to Coding introduced me to HTML & CSS and so on.<br>
     Sooner, the excitment of having the power to structure pages on my own sounded <br>amazing and thatâ€™s 
     when I decided to purse Web development.<br> 
     Recently, I learnt Full Stack Development. I have knowledge of HTML, CSS ,Python and JavaScript.<br>
     Rational thought process and goal-oriented planning are my strengths.<br>
     I am currently on the look out for a path to my Career.</p></center>
